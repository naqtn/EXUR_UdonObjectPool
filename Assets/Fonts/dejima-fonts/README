Characters in mincho directory are modified by myself.  Note this fonts does not
necessarily follow JIS or Unicode unification rule.

To create TrueType font, substituting not yet available characters
from Sazanami fonts, you need to get Sazanami fonts and create fontorge
SFD files from individual files first.

Sazanmi font is available from http://sourceforge.jp/projects/efont/

To create Dejima Mincho SFD file from individual data, run the following from the
command line:

% (cd mincho; ../merge.rb > dejima-mincho.sfd)

Then place sazanami-mincho.ttf in this directory and run the followng:

% fontforge -script tt.pe

If you don't have fontforge installed, please see
http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/ and install it.

The font is licensed under MIT license.  See LICENSE file for the detail.
